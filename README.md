Students should use this rubric: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3072588797

for self-checking their submission.

Improvements made for 3rd submission with js/app.js based on reviewer's comments.
	1. Changed the constants style according to the guide.

Summary of improvement for 2nd submission.

1. Ran the code of app.js to JSHint (per reviewer's suggestion), fixed the code such as adding/deleting semicolon.
2. Modified the index.html so that engine.js is loaded before app.js, which fixed the problem that game couldn't be iniated.
3. updated this README file to include the improvements made and the instructions on how to play the game (see below).

Instructions on how to load and play the game:

1. Download the GitHub Zip to your computer, extract the files and run the index.html in your favoriate browser, e.g. google chrome. Alternatively, you can fork the repository, load teh index.html into your chrome browser to load the game.

2. The little boy on the grass is the player and the moving bugs are his enemies.

3. You need to move the boy player by moving up, left, right or down using the arrow keys on the keyboard. The goal for the player is to move across the stone field and successfully get to the water area which then initates another round of game.

4. When player is crossing the stone field, he has to avoid the enemy bugs, otherwises, the player will be killed and the game starts all over again.

5. I set the speed of the moving bugs pretty fast, so it is challenging for the boy player to go across the stone field. Good luck playing it!
